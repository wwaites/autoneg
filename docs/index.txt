CGI Content Autonegotiation
===========================

This is a simple (Fast)CGI application that performs HTTP
auto-negotiation and serves files staticly. It can be installed
in the usual way with one of::

    % pip install autoneg
    % easy_install autoneg

It is intended to facilitate serving of different variants
of an HTTP resource according to the requested content type.
In this way one can pre-render RDF/XML, N3, HTML, plain text,
etc variants of a document and save them to the filesystem
to be served directly rather than relying on complicated
databases or middleware.

Scripts
-------

.. automodule:: autoneg.app

NGINX Configuration
-------------------

Example configuration for a global installation::

        location / {
            index index.html index.htm
            try_files $uri $uri/ /autoneg$uri;
            autoindex on;
        }

        location ~ ^/autoneg {
            fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/autoneg.sock;
            include        fastcgi_params;
        }

And then the script could be launched with a command like::

        % spawn-fcgi -P /var/run/autoneg.pid -s /var/run/autoneg.sock -M 0666 \
            -- autoneg_fcgi -c conf.py -b /var/www

the *try_files* means that if the file exists on disk it will
be served correctly. Otherwise the request will be passed 
internally to the autonegotiation service.
